            My name is Cody Yancey, and this is my first webpage. My intent is to 
        introduce myself, and eventually showcase any coding projects I am working on
        or have completed.
        </p>

        My goals for this page are as follows:

        <ul>
            <li>Create an online footpringt</li>
            <li>Showcase my progress in learning to code</li>
            <li>Keep myself organized and motivated</li>
        </ul>
